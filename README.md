#### Annotations
###### Notes:
    
    There are a number of restrictions that apply to annotation declarations. 
    
    First, no annotation can inherit another. 
    
    Second, all methods declared by an annotation must be without parameters. Furthermore, they must return one of the following:
    
    •  A primitive type, such as int or double
    
    •  An object of type String or Class
    
    •  An object of an enum type
    
    •  An object of another annotation type
    
    •  An array of a legal type.
    
    Annotations cannot be generic. In other words, they cannot take type parameters. 
    
    Annotation methods cannot specify a throws clause.
